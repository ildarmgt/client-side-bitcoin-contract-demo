# Slides and corresponding code for BitcoinPHL meetup

For my experiment and demo only.

`create.html` and `create.js` are to calculate contract address

`spend.html` and `spend.js` are to build a tx for me to spend from contract

`family_spend.html` and `family_spend.js` are to build a tx for my family to spend from contract

`slides.pptx` and `slides_no_animation.pdf` are the slides

Code is somewhat compressed for fitting onto slides easier so comments are limited.
Similar code was created in node.js with possibly better comments [here](https://github.com/ildarmgt/bitcoin-smart-contracts/tree/master/contracts/inheritance_timer).
